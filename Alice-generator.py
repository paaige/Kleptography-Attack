# This generates a random public and private key for Alice. Note that this
# will also be used to generate a random public and private key for the
# attacker.

# This program takes a prime p and a generator g as input
# Outputs a private key and a public key for Alice into a file
# "Alice-key.txt". It will output a file "attacker-key.txt" if
# "Alice-key.txt" already exists.
